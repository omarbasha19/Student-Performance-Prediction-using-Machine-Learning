# Student Performance Analysis üìä

## Overview üåê

The **Student Performance Analysis** project aims to analyze the academic performance of students using data from two datasets: "student-mat.csv" (Mathematics) and "student-por.csv" (Portuguese). The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook (`p.ipynb`). The project explores various aspects such as the impact of study time, family background, and social factors on students' grades, and uses data visualization to present findings.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, duplicates, and prepares data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides insights into the distribution of grades, study time, and other attributes.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifies significant correlations between student attributes and their academic performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implements machine learning models to predict student performance based on various features.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Provides actionable insights based on the analysis to help educators and policy-makers.

## Datasets üìÇ

- **student-mat.csv:** Contains data related to students' performance in mathematics.
![student-mat.csv](https://github.com/omarbasha19/Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data/student-mat.csv)
- **student-por.csv:** Contains data related to students' performance in the Portuguese language.
![student-por.csv](https://github.com/omarbasha19/Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data/student-por.csv)
  
Both datasets include various attributes such as gender, age, study time, family background, absences, and final grades (G1, G2, G3).

## How It Works üïπÔ∏è

1. **Load Data:** The notebook starts by loading the datasets from CSV files.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and processes categorical data.
3. **EDA and Visualization:** Generates visualizations to explore the data and understand relationships between features.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Computes correlations to find significant relationships.
5. **Predictive Modeling:** Applies machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to predict final grades.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for conducting the analysis and visualizing data.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for predictive modeling.

## Conclusion üìù

The **Student Performance Analysis** project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing students' academic outcomes. By leveraging data science techniques, this analysis helps identify key areas for intervention and improvement. The project is ideal for data analysts, educators, and policy-makers interested in understanding educational data.
